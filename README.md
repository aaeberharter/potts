# Potts Model Simulation
Interactive Monte-Carlo simulation of the 2D Q-states Potts model, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potts_model  
Simulation parameters can be changed in real-time  
Physics is done on CPU, down-sampling of the state is done on GPU  
Planned changes revolve around moving the physical simulation onto GPU
